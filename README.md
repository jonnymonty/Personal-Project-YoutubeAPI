## Reflection

  - I started this project to experiment a little with the Youtube API and also refresh my knowledge on JQuery.
  - I wanted to create a way for me to navigate through the youtube channels I would watch and catch up on their latest videos.
  - The youtube API was tough to learn at first, one of the main challenges I faced was authentication and creating/restricting my API Key.
